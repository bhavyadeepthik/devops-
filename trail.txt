trying to create a new branch from the local repo 
git branch local 

we switched into the branch local 

after creating branch we used touch to create afile from cli and vim to edit the file created. 

later we add the file created in the branch local by using commands git add 
git commit filename -m "msg"

git push is used to push the branch<<<<<blocked with suggestion to add set upstram command along with push .... to add the locally created branch for the first time into remote repo 
git push --set-upstream origin local
